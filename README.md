# My Advent of Code solutions

These are not guaranteed to be complete. I do them when I have time.

Both 2021's and 2022's solutions are in [ngn/k](https://codeberg.org/ngn/k), grouped in a single file `soln.k`, in which solution functions are listed as `sXY`, `X` being the day number, `Y` being part 1 (`a`) or part 2 (`b`), for example `s5b` is the part 2 to day 5.

2023's solutions are in [noulith](https://github.com/crides/noulith) (this is forked, but my changes add some useful features which may or may not get used). Solutions are as `dXY`, `X` being the day number and `Y` being part 1 (`a`) or part 2 (`b`), for example `s5b` is the part 2 to day 5. Same goes for input/test files just without the `d`. There's `run.noul` that makes it a little easier to run/test stuff on given inputs.
