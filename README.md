# My Advent of Code solutions

These are not guaranteed to be complete. I do them when I have time.

Both 2021's and 2022's solutions are in [ngn/k](https://codeberg.org/ngn/k), grouped in a single file `soln.k`, in which solution functions are listed as `sXY`, `X` being the day number, `Y` being part 1 (`a`) or part 2 (`b`), for example `s5b` is the part 2 to day 5.
